# version 1.2.3

  * Added a lot of other css snippets;
  * Changed some styles to be accorded to resizable sidebar and search container;
  * Removed sidebar resize icon due problems with (something that I don't know yet);
  * I've felt more performance like that, maybe i'm wrong, i'm not sure.
  
  ### Obs: 

    - Resizing sidebar may brake the animations when selecting channel  ;), **CTRL OR CMD + R** to reload app with normal values.
